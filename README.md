Processing of data with prediction using ARIMA model 

Mysql to store all data and prediction algorithm

Currently the project is using excel sheets for data storage and we are using Google Looker studio for data visualisation which we will shift to Mysql with Recharts and React-chartjs-2 for data visualisation in upcoming version.
